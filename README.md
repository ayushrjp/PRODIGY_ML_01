#  Task 01: House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project was completed as part of my **Machine Learning Internship at Prodigy InfoTech**.  
The goal was to build a basic regression model that predicts house prices using essential features like:

- Square Footage
- Number of Bedrooms
- Number of Bathrooms
- Year Built

##  What I Did

- Cleaned and preprocessed data using **Pandas** and **NumPy**
- Handled missing values using **median imputation**
- Scaled numerical features using **StandardScaler**
- Trained a **Linear Regression** model using **Scikit-learn**
- Evaluated performance using **RMSE** and **R² Score**
- Applied **log transformation** to normalize skewed price data
- Exported predictions to a CSV file
- Saved the trained model using **Joblib**
